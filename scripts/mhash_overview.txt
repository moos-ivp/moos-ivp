---------------------------------------
mhash_archive_all.sh will process the current directory or given 
  directory, and recursively archive any folders  
  containining an alog file.

---------------------------------------
mhash_archive_dir.sh will archive log folders in the current dir 
  creating common folder based on mission hash for
  each folder. Usually N vehicles plus shoreside. 
                                                  
  For each mission a single folder and tar file   
  of that folder will be created.                 
                                                  
  The tar file can optionally be sent to a server 
  for archiving. The directory on that server may 
  be specified.                                   
                                                  
  Optionally the tar file can be removed upon a   
  successful send.                                
                                                  
  NOTE: This tool is used in mission folders where
        where the whole N-vehicle simulation took 
        place, unlike on a vehicle or PABLO where 
        the log file(s) represent a single node.
